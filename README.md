* Golf game terrain highlight widget

The goal with this test is to implement the widget used in a lot of golf games to highlight the way the ball will roll on terrain. We want to overlay a grid over the terrain and we will color the grid segments in red to show higher terrain and in blue for lower terrain. We will show same levels as white. We want to blend between the colors based on min/max values for the whole  grid.
